        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Yazhu Tan, and I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University. 
            I am currently majoring in Finance with a minor in Data Science, 
            combining my interests in financial analysis and data-driven decision-making. 
            My finance studies provide me with a strong foundation in investment strategies, risk management, 
            and corporate finance, while my data science coursework enhances my ability to analyze and interpret complex datasets. 
            By integrating these two disciplines, 
            I aim to develop valuable insights that can drive strategic financial decisions in various industries. 
            This combination not only equips me with analytical and technical skills 
            but also allows me to explore the growing role of data science in modern finance, 
            such as algorithmic trading, financial modeling, and risk assessment.
