        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I enjoy reading, walking, and watching movies, as they allow me to relax and expand my perspective. 
            Reading helps me gain knowledge and explore different ideas, whether through finance-related books, fiction, or non-fiction. 
            Walking is a great way for me to clear my mind and stay active, often providing moments of reflection or creative thinking. 
            Watching movies is another passion of mine, 
            as it exposes me to different cultures, storytelling techniques, and artistic expressions. 
            These hobbies complement my academic interests by keeping me curious, engaged, 
            and balanced in both my professional and personal life.
